# Regression Modeling for Linguistic Data book: v. 1.1

This repository contains the public version of _Regression Modeling for Linguistic Data_, a book under contract with MIT Press.   RMLD is an intermediate book on statistical analysis for language scientists.  This version (1.1) should be very similar to the published book.  **This repository is a clone of the book's [OSF site](https://osf.io/pnumg/)**, which sometimes gets flagged as spam.

Please cite the current version (v. 1.1) if you use this book. Comments are welcome (morgan.sonderegger@gmail.com).  Please see license info (below).

**Contents**:

* rmld_v1.1.pdf : The full book
* ch10_appendix.html : Chapter 10 online-only appendix.


*Data* folder: datasets analyzed in the book (CSVs)

*Code* folder:
* `source`: source code for each chapter (Rnw/Rmd files)---only needed to compile the book.
* `R`: code files showing all R commands used in each chapter, including for making plots (R)
* The code file for each chapter is just all the R code in each Rnw/Rmd file, extracted.

## Overview

The book introduces applied regression analysis for language scientists, using R and (mainly) tidyverse functionality. It aims to provide both conceptual understanding and practical skills through extensive examples with different kinds of linguistic data.  The primary differences from existing texts on quantitative analysis of linguistic data (e.g. Baayen, Winter, Gries, Levshina, K. Johnson) are that we focus on regression analysis, and do not start from scratch. The book assumes you have familiarity with basic statistical analysis (e.g. t-tests, ANOVAs), R, and math, but it aims to be readable regardless.
